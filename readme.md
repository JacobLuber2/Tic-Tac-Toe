# Tic-Tac-Toe

## About

- An interactive web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to take turns, keeps track of the board state, announces the winner, or declares a tie if no one wins.
- I made this as an optional project for the TrueCoders Full-Stack Web Development course to demonstrate my competence in object-oriented programming.

## Usage:

- You enter a name click submit button, repeat again
- Click a square
- If you have 3 of your symbols back to back in any order (row, coulumn, diagonal) You won!
- Click the reset board button to reset upon finishing the game or whenever else

## Future Features:

- **Improve the UI/UX and make the styling more responsive**
- **Play an animation based off who won or if the game ended in a draw**
- **online multiplayer**
